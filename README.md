# **Scientific Calculator**

A Python Tkinter GUI calculator supporting basic arithmetic, scientific, and combinatorial operations in a clean, user-friendly interface.

---

## **Features**
- **Basic Arithmetic:** +, -, *, /  
- **Scientific Functions:** sin, cos, tan, log, ln, √, powers (^), factorial (!)  
- **Constants:** π, e  
- **Combinatorial Functions:** nCr, nPr  
- **Input Management:** AC (clear all), DEL (delete last character)  
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handles invalid inputs  
- **Keyboard Input Support:** Enter numbers and operations directly from your keyboard

## **Technologies Used**
- Python 3.x  
- Tkinter for GUI  
- Math module for calculations  
- Regex (re module) for input parsing  

---

## **Development Approach**
- Designed a professional and user-friendly GUI using Tkinter  
- Implemented buttons and input parsing with regex and math module for natural expression handling  
- Ensured continuous layout and minimized empty space for a clean interface  
- Added error handling to manage invalid inputs without crashing  
- Incorporated scientific, combinatorial, and basic arithmetic functions in a single interface

## **Future Improvements**
- Enable keyboard input support for faster operation  
- Implement dark mode toggle for better user experience  
- Add memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC) to store and recall values  
- Improve GUI responsiveness and adaptive scaling for different screen sizes
